# üì¶ Momentum-Based Strategy

This repository explores a sector-based event investing approach using stocks from the **Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)**, categorized by **Bloomberg GICS industry classification**.

---

### üß† Strategy Concept

The core idea is to simulate how an investor might respond to real-world sector-specific events (supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and so on) by taking broad exposure to relevant sectors **after** they‚Äôve already shown signs of strength.

Rather than relying on news directly, this strategy identifies sectors that have demonstrated **recent strong momentum**, then enters positions across all stocks within that sector. The logic is reactive, not predictive in order to avoiding forward looking bias.

| Metric                    | Value            |
|---------------------------|------------------|
| **Period**                | 2000-10-22 to 2025-04-13 |
| **Initial Balance**       | Rp1,000,000       |
| **Final Balance**         | Rp490,888,775     |
| **Total Return**          | 48,375.66%        |
| **Annualized Return**     | 28.75%            |
| **Annualized Volatility** | 26.99%            |
| **Sharpe Ratio**          | 1.06              |
| **Max Drawdown**          | -56.19%           |
|                           |                  |
| **Benchmark Return**      | 1,939.33%         |
| **Benchmark Max Drawdown**| -59.50%           |
| **Total Alpha**           | 46,463.33%        |
| **Annualized Alpha**      | 28.53%            |

**Backtest Interpretation:**  

Fee Assumptions: The above result assumes the use of fee rebates. Without rebates and using the average fee from prop firms (0.01% per tx), the strategy yields a final return of approximately 40,408%.

### üîÆ Monte Carlo Simulation

![Monte Carlo Preview](Monte%20Carlo%20-%20Preview.png)

We also ran a **Monte Carlo simulation** using past weekly returns to forecast performance over the **next 3 years or 156 weeks**, which supports the strategy‚Äôs reliability.

**MONTE CARLO SIMULATION PARAMETERS**  
| Parameter                     | Value        |
|------------------------------|--------------|
| Historical mean weekly return | 0.5529%      |
| Historical weekly volatility  | 3.7410%      |
| Simulation periods            | 3 years |
| Number of simulations         | 500          |

**SIMULATION RESULTS**  
| Metric                      | Value        |
|----------------------------|--------------|
| Mean final cumulative return | 124.77%     |
| Median final cumulative return | 104.88%   |
| Top 5% outcome              | 303.24%      |
| Bottom 5% outcome           | 0.20%        |
| Probability of positive return | 95.4%     |

**Monte Carlo Interpretation:**  

With Monte Carlo simulation, the result is remarkably strong. Forward simulating for 3 years, the **chance of a positive return is 95.4%**.  
To put that into perspective:  

- Imagine you're blindfolded, and in front of you are **100 toys** some **red** (success) and some **blue** (failure). You reach out and randomly pick **one toy at a time**, doing this **100 times**. Now imagine that **95 of those 100 toys turn out to be red**. That‚Äôs how good this strategy‚Äôs odds look.
- You roll a six sided die 100 times and land on a six 95 times. That‚Äôs not random anymore, that‚Äôs a strategy on steroids.

And it‚Äôs not just about *not losing*. The **mean return** of **124.77% over 3 years** equates to CAGR of roughly **30.5%**, which is **excellent** especially considering the conservative, reactionary nature of the strategy.

### üéØ Objective

To evaluate whether **reactive sector exposure** can yield positive returns when applied systematically and without hindsight.
